# Election_Analysis2
Election_Analysis2 was created to store all of the details and analysis pertinent to the Colorado election results in several counties. This file tracks all of the coding for many of the steps in the module, as wll as the results. 

## Project Overview
The election commitee asked me to summarize the voting information and provide a summary of winner and county statistics. 

## Resources
- Election Results csv
- VS Code
- Python 3.7
- GitHub
- GitBash

## Summary
Tom and Seth, part of the Election Committee, wanted to know the number of votes, the number of candidates and the voting results for each of the canditates. In addition, they wanted to know who was the winner of the election. 

The results were as follows:
Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369,711
-------------------------
County Votes:
Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
-------------------------
Largest county turnout: Denver
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
------------------------
WINNER: Diana DeGette
WINNING VOTE COUNT: 272,892
WINNING %: 73.8%

## Challenge Overview
The intial project was to report the number of votes and candidate information. Then, I expanded the analysis to provide details of the largest county turnout and winner. Denver was the winning county, with Ms. Diana DeGette gaining 73.8% of the vote, which is 272,892 voters. 

## Challenge Summary
Using for loops, if statements and the with open function, I was able to complete this analysis and provide Tom and Seth the voting results information they needed to declare a winner. This would not have been possible without walking thru the lessons a couple of times and getting the assistance of TAs like Tarique Shams and Luke Chen who observed the steps and gave invaluable input for optimum results.
